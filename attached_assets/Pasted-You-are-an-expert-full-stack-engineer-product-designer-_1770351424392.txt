You are an expert full-stack engineer + product designer. Build me a production-grade personal portfolio website for “Aditya Deshpande” with a premium, modern design and unique interactive elements. I will run this on Replit, then later deploy. Output a complete repo with clear setup instructions.

GOALS
1) Make it feel like a top-tier AI/PM portfolio (beautiful + fast).
2) Showcase my work experience, projects (with videos), education, publications.
3) Add weekly writing: Blog posts + “Product Breakdowns” (PM-style).
4) Add TWO signature AI features:
   A) RAG-powered chatbot that can answer anything about my resume, work, projects, skills, publications, and blog posts, with citations linking to sources.
   B) Voice AI agent: users can talk to it; it answers about me; also shows transcript + clickable citations/links.

TECH REQUIREMENTS (use these defaults)
- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components + Framer Motion
- Content: MDX for Blog + Product Breakdowns
- Backend API routes in Next.js for chat + ingestion
- Vector DB: start with local (SQLite-based) + embeddings (so it works in Replit). If possible, implement with:
  - Embeddings: OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small) OR if no key, fall back to a local embedding model option (document how).
  - Vector store: use a simple local store (SQLite + cosine similarity) or a lightweight library that works in Node.
- LLM: OpenAI chat completion (document env vars)
- Voice:
  - Option 1 (preferred): Web Speech API for mic capture + browser TTS for playback, plus server-side LLM response.
  - Option 2: If available, OpenAI Realtime / speech endpoints (only if easy). Keep it modular.

ENV VARS
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- (optional) SITE_URL

SITE PAGES / SECTIONS
1) Home (hero, value prop, featured projects, key metrics, CTA)
2) About (short bio + skills tags)
3) Experience (timeline + impact bullets)
4) Projects (cards with filters; each project has case-study page)
   - Each project page: problem, solution, stack, architecture diagram placeholder, impact metrics, video embed section.
5) Writing
   - Blog (weekly posts)
   - Product Breakdowns (weekly PM tear-downs) with a consistent template
6) Publications
7) Contact (social links + email + calendly placeholder)
8) Resume (download link placeholder)

DESIGN DIRECTION
- Premium AI/startup feel: clean typography, subtle gradients, strong spacing, high contrast.
- Add a unique cursor interaction:
  - Implement a “bubble / gooey” cursor trail that subtly reacts to motion.
  - Also add “magnetic hover” on buttons/cards.
- Add micro-interactions: smooth page transitions, hover states, skeleton loaders.
- Must be fast: Lighthouse-minded, minimal bloat.

AI FEATURE 1: RAG CHATBOT
- Floating chat widget on all pages (bottom-right).
- Chat can answer questions about me. It must:
  - Retrieve context from: a) /data/resume.md b) /data/projects/*.md c) /data/experience.md d) /content/blog/*.mdx e) /content/product-breakdowns/*.mdx f) /data/publications.md
  - Chunk docs, embed, store in local vector DB.
  - Provide citations: show title + link to source section/page used.
  - Have “Suggested questions” chips.
  - Have modes: Recruiter | Engineering | PM (affects tone/verbosity).
- Include a simple admin/dev endpoint or script: `npm run ingest` to rebuild embeddings when content changes.

AI FEATURE 2: VOICE AGENT
- A dedicated “Talk to Aditya” page + small mic button inside chat widget.
- Press-to-talk or toggle recording (simple).
- Convert speech to text (Web Speech API acceptable).
- Send transcript to the same RAG backend; return response.
- Read response aloud (Web Speech API TTS acceptable).
- Show transcript + citations + “copy answer” button.

DATA / CONTENT
- Include realistic placeholder content for:
  - 6 projects (with stack tags, impact bullets, and a “video url” placeholder)
  - 3 experience roles
  - education
  - 2 publications
  - 3 blog posts
  - 2 product breakdowns
- Keep everything editable as markdown/MDX in folders.

ARCHITECTURE
- /app routes for pages
- /components for UI
- /lib/rag for ingestion, chunking, embedding, retrieval
- /app/api/chat route for chat
- /app/api/ingest route (protected by a simple dev token or only in dev)
- Clear separation of concerns.

SECURITY / QUALITY
- Don’t expose OPENAI_API_KEY to client.
- Rate limit chat endpoints lightly (basic in-memory limiter ok).
- Add basic prompt injection defenses (only answer about Aditya; refuse unrelated).
- Error handling + loading states.

DELIVERABLES
1) Full repo code
2) README with:
   - how to run
   - env vars
   - how ingestion works
   - how to add new blog posts/product breakdowns
   - how to deploy later

IMPORTANT
- Make it look excellent out of the box.
- Prioritize working end-to-end in Replit.
- Keep dependencies reasonable.
